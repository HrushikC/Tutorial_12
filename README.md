# tutor_website

***
Group Project: Online website for matching tutors with students locally or even far away if they choose to work online. It will include numerous subject areas including STEM, humanities, and even life skills. In the future, once we gain traction, we will also have local businesses and nonprofits register to our site for tutors to apply to so they may work or volunteer with them.

Current Issues that need fixing:
- Must work on filter menu and learn how to edit django filters without coding everything manually.
