Group Project: Online website for matching tutors with students locally. It will include numerous subject areas including life skills. In the future, we will also have local businesses and nonprofits for tutors to apply to in order to work or volunteer for them.

Current Issues that need fixing:
- the id field of tutor profiles has issues if the data is deleted as the id continues to increment while the user-id stays the same. This causes the profile-detail view to present the wrong profile when the username is clicked in the browse_tutors page.
